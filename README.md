# dbt-blueprint
This repo is a comprehensive blueprint of how to use dbt to run data pipelines using databricks compute. It showcases modular project structure, data contracts, various tests, incremental models with selectors and Terraform-provisioned Databricks Workflows. No real financial data is used, only dummy data.
